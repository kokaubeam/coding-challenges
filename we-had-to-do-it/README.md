# We Had to Do It

It's widely known that there are many "programmers" out there who are CHARLATANS and who don't actually know how to write code. By legend, FizzBuzz is the problem that can seperate the wheat from the chaff.

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to [x].
- For multiples of [y] print “Fizz” instead of the number.
- For multiples of [z] print “Buzz”.
- For numbers which are multiples of both [y] and [z] print “FizzBuzz”.
- Line 1 of input is an integer [x]
- Line 2 of input is an integer [y]
- Line 3 of input is an integer [z]

Be you programmer or be you imposter?
